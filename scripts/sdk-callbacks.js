 *   onResponseFromUnreal     your app sent something back to the page
 *   onSessionEnding          the stream is ending - show your own screen

 * This sample does the former: it puts the message on screen in an overlay,
 * which you are meant to replace with your own - see the marked block below.
 * DO NOT write code that inspects the wording to work out what happened - treat
 *        it as text for a person, since the exact wording can change.
