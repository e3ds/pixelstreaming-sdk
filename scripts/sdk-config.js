/**
 * ⚠️  YOUR API KEY — READ THIS BEFORE YOU DEPLOY ANYTHING  ⚠️
 *
 * Get this from your Eagle 3D Streaming dashboard and paste it below.
 *
 * BE AWARE OF WHAT THIS MEANS: anything in a web page is visible to anyone who
 * visits it. A key placed here can be read by any visitor using their browser's
 * developer tools. That is acceptable for a local experiment or an internal
 * demo, and it is why this demo is written the way it is.
 *
 * For anything public, DO NOT ship your key to the browser. Instead:
 *
 *   1. Keep the key on your own server, where visitors cannot read it.
 *   2. Have your server call the token endpoint (see sdk-token.js) and
 *      return only the resulting short-lived token to the page.
 *   3. Point requestSessionToken() at your own endpoint instead of calling
 *      Eagle 3D Streaming's directly.
 *
 * The token itself is safe to send to the browser: it expires quickly and is
 * scoped to a single session. The API key is not - it does not expire, and it
 * can be used to start sessions billed to your account.
 *
 * NEVER commit a real key to a public repository. If you ever have, treat it
 * as compromised and issue a new one from the dashboard.
 *
 * Where this comes from, and how it differs from a session token:
 *   https://learn.eagle3dstreaming.com/wiki/api-keys-and-tokens
 *   https://controlpanel.eagle3dstreaming.com/developer-section
 *
 * That second link is also the quickest way to test without writing anything:
 * the Token Generation tab hands you a session token directly, so you can
 * confirm an app streams before integrating at all.
