/**
 * demo-ui-connection-setup.js — let someone try the demo without editing sdk-config.js.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * sdk-config.js ships with placeholders. Until now, opening this page without
 * editing that file first produced an alert() saying "STREAMING_API_KEY is
 * still the placeholder" and nothing else - a dead end for anyone who just
 * wanted to see the demo work, and especially for anyone opening it from a
 * hosted URL where editing the file is not an option at all.
 *
 * So: if the code has not been filled in, ask in the page instead of refusing.
 * Editing sdk-config.js still works exactly as before and always wins where it is
 * set - this only fills gaps.
 *
 * ── Where the values go ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Into localStorage on the viewer's own browser, and nowhere else. They are
 * never sent anywhere except the same token endpoint sdk-config.js would have used.
 * This is deliberately the same trade-off sdk-config.js already makes and documents:
 * a key in the page is readable by anyone who can open devtools. It is fine for
 * a demo or an internal test, and it is NOT how a production integration should
 * work - there, your own server holds the key and returns only a token. See the
 * warning at the top of sdk-config.js.
 *
 * Because of that, the panel says so on screen rather than burying it here.

/** True when sdk-config.js has not had a real key pasted into it. */
/* [E3DS-SDK-KEY-SCOPE] Read the IDENTIFIER, not the window property.
 *
 * sdk-config.js declares `const STREAMING_API_KEY = "..."`, and a top-level const in
 * a classic script does NOT become a property of window - it lives in the global
 * lexical environment instead. `var` and `function` do; `const` and `let` never
 * do, in a script or a module.
 *
 * So window.STREAMING_API_KEY was always undefined, this always answered
 * "missing", and the setup panel opened on EVERY load no matter what real key
 * had been pasted into sdk-config.js. Typing the key into the panel was the only
 * thing that worked, because that value goes to window.__e3dsApiKeyOverride,
 * which really is a window property - so localStorage was quietly rescuing a
 * configuration that could never work on its own.
 *
 * FIXED HERE RATHER THAN BY CHANGING sdk-config.js TO `var`. That would work today
 * and fail twice over: `var` is not a window property inside a bundle either,
 * and our own template and README both show `const`, so every integrator who
 * copies our documentation would hit exactly this. Reading the identifier works
 * for const or var, in a script or a bundle, in their file or ours.
 *
 * typeof on a bare identifier is the one form that does not throw when it is
 * undeclared, which keeps this file loadable on its own. window is still
 * consulted as a fallback, so anyone who deliberately set it there is honoured.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The panel used to appear only when the configuration was
 * incomplete, which meant the values it saves became unreachable the moment the
 * configuration was complete - you could store an app name that overrode
 * sdk-config.js and then have no way to see it, change it, or clear it except by
 * editing localStorage in devtools. Asked for on 2026-09-09: "need to have
 * ability to call the ui and modify stuff there".
 *
 * Call it from anywhere:
 *
 *     e3dsOpenConnectionSetup();
 *
 * or press the demo's "Connection settings" button. Changes apply to the page
 * immediately - the next stream you start uses them, with no reload.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true if saved, false if dismissed.

/* PUBLIC ENTRY POINT for an integrator's own page - a different audience from
 * the rest of this file, which is internal to the panel.
 *
 * No `window.` assignment: these are classic scripts, so this declaration is
 * already a global. One was here and did nothing. */

/* Applied as soon as this file runs, so anything reading STREAMING_CONFIG
 * afterwards already sees the saved values and no caller needs to know this
 * file exists. Loaded after sdk-config.js and before sdk-token.js. */
